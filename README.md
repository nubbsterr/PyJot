# PyJot âœ¨
A lightweight notepad application built on Tkinter in Python :)

# "What does it do bro?" ðŸ¤”
PyJot has all the regular features of any normal notepad. You can create, load and save files in the UI by using what I call the Master Box (see image below!)

The Master Box is that tiny Entry box with the "Untitled File" text. This is where you would:
- Specify the file you want to <strong>create</strong>.
- Specify the file you want to <strong>save</strong> (will create a new file if it doesn't exist!)
- Specify the file you want to <strong>load</strong> (loads the text content into the Text entry area below)

Files by default will be created in the local directory of this programs' script. That is, wherever <a href= "https://github.com/nubbsterr/PyJot/blob/main/notepad.py" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;" >notepad.py</a> is located on your PC. <strong>It's recommended you move files to the location of the script, otherwise you'll need to specify the complete file path of whatever text file you wish to load.</strong>

That isn't everything there is to this application, but I'm not looking to rot your brain any further, so let's move on :)

# "Why should I use it?" ðŸ™„
I'm not gonna say this thing is revolutionary or anything, because it isn't! I made this notepad as a small side project and want to showcase my work to the internet :)

If you seriously want to go ahead and use it, feel free to do so! If you wanna tinker with the code itself, you can do so, provided you credit me appropriately (a link back to this repo would be neat).

# Afterword ðŸ©·
If somehow people migrate here and plead to me to update this app and truly make it worth using. I'll definitely do so, but besides that, I plan to just showcase projects here (on GitHub) for funsies. If you wanna contact me, you can do so on Discord with my username: <strong>nubbieeee</strong>
